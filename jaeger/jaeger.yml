sampling:
  # Available sampling strategies: const, probabilistic, rateLimiting, remote
  # Use "const" sampling to sample every trace or "probabilistic" to sample a
  # fraction of traces.
  # For more details on these strategies, see: https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/sampling/
  strategy: const
  # Only sample 10% of traces
  param: 0.1

# Configuration for the Jaeger agent, which receives spans from applications
# and forwards them to the collector. You may have multiple agents, in which
# case they will all forward to the same collector(s).
# For more details, see: https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.18/deployment/#agent
agent:
  # The host and port of the Jaeger agent
  host: jaeger-agent
  port: 6831

# Configuration for the Jaeger collector, which receives spans from the agents
# and forwards them to the storage backend. You may have multiple collectors,
# in which case they will all forward to the same storage backend(s).
# For more details, see: https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.18/deployment/#collector
collector:
  # The endpoint(s) of the Jaeger collector(s), in the format "host:port".
  # You may specify multiple collectors separated by commas. The agents will
  # load balance between them.
  endpoint: "jaeger-collector:14268"
